# arwassa-website
My first website built with HTML and CSS

I'm wanting to build websites to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The only coding experience I have prior is with Python so I'm learning from scratch using YouTube tutorials and applying what I've learnt in a practical manner by giving myself this project.

The project is to build a website for my band Arwassa.

The initial design of this was to have a site that will essentially be an EPK.

It will have a Home page with an additional 6 pages for About, Music, Merch, Videos, Shows and Contact 

As of 04.01.24, I have built the bones of the website and have begun designing the aspects with CSS.

-- Plans --

I wish to have a fully working website that will be continuously improved and edited as more content for the band is release.
I want to include some animations such as an intro splash screen that you click to enter, with a gif background.
I want to use the knowledge I gain from this to be able to build more websites in future.

-- Progress --

I have a complete About and Video page in terms of content. Fonts need to be finalised.
Contact page is completed with working boxes that get sent to the band email address.
Completed social media icons with a small animation when hovering
Embedded a music player from Bandcamp using the code they provided to the home and about screen. 
(Had difficulty with sizing for the larger player when trying to assign it to the right side of the page as it created a large amount of space. Not sure what the fix is, reverted to smaller player until I figure this out/get guidence.)
