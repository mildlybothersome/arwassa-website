# arwassa-website
My first website built with HTML and CSS

I'm wanting to build websites to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The only coding experience I have prior is with Python so I'm learning from scratch using YouTube tutorials and applying what I've learnt in a practical manner by giving myself this project.

The project is to build a website for my band Arwassa.

The initial design of this was to have a site that will essentially be an EPK.

It will have a Home page with an additional 6 pages for About, Music, Merch, Videos, Shows and Contact 

As of 04.01.24, I have built the bones of the website and have begun designing the aspects with CSS.

-- Plans --

I wish to have a fully working website that will be continuously improved and edited as more content for the band is release.
I want to include some animations such as an intro splash screen that you click to enter, with a gif background.
I want to use the knowledge I gain from this to be able to build more websites in future.

-- Progress --

I have a complete About and Video page in terms of content. Fonts need to be finalised.
Contact page is completed with working boxes that get sent to the band email address.
